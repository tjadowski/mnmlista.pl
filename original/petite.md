petite-productivity

There exists in France a small company called Teddyfish that makes bags by hand.

Their philosophy of production is beautiful:

“We believe in ‘petite-production’, which means the willingness to work on
slower rhythm and scale. Through creating and hand-making by ourselves, we are
aiming to flavor our products with the warmth of the craftsmen’s hands, instead
of the gasoline from the machine.”

Imagine if our world of mass-production was turned into a world of petite-production. People would hand-make clothing bicycles furniture food.

We would produce less and consume less. Things would cost more but people would
make more for their labor.

We would love our work more. Produce quality things that last. Love our lives
more. Call it Anti-Walmartization.

Slow down make less do it better be happier.
