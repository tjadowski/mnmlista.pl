minimalism isn’t traveling the world with nothing

I read a post recently where a blogger and commenters were talking about how
minimalism sucks, because owning nothing and traveling the world with nothing
but a small suitcase means you’d never have savings or a safe home for your
kids.

Well. There are a couple issues here to discuss.

First, the kind of minimalism they’re referring to is only one way to do it.

Sure, lots of minimalists are bachelors who can easily work anywhere and travel
the world with a backpack, or perhaps families who travel and work and live all
over the place with almost no possessions. But that’s just one way.

Another way is to live in a home that’s big enough (but not overly huge) for
your family’s needs, and to only have what you need and not too much more, and
to not focus so much on consumption but more on doing the things you love with
the people you love.

And yes, you can travel the world from time to time, with just a small backpack
each. But that’s just one part of your life. At least, that’s how we do it.

So minimalism isn’t just one way of life. It’s figuring out what works best for
you (and your family if you have one) but being more mindful of what you own
and do. Not obsessing over possessions, but being mindful. It’s about finding
contentment.

Second, you can have a savings as a minimalist. In fact, many minimalists do.

It’s often *easier* to have savings, because if you’re spending less on
needless possessions and a huge home and a couple of huge vehicles, you can put
more money in the bank or for retirement. You can do this as a single person,
but also as a family. I would recommend it — having savings gives you peace of
mind.

Just wanted to clear up those misconceptions.
