the only thing you can change

You can’t change your entire life.
You can only change your next action.

—

You can’t change a relationship with a loved one.
You can only change your next interaction.

—

You can’t change your entire job.
You can only change your next task.

—

You can’t change your body composition.
You can only change your next meal.

—

You can’t change your fitness level.
You can only start moving.

—

You can’t declutter your entire life.
You can only choose to get rid of one thing, right now.

—

You can’t eliminate your entire debt.
You can only make one payment, or buy one less unnecessary item.

—

You can’t change the past, or control the future.
You can only change what you’re doing right now.

—

You can’t change everything.
You can only change one, small thing.

And that’s all it takes.
