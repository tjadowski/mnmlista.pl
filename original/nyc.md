a minimalist in NYC

I’ve only been in New York City for about four days, but I can easily see how
it would be tough to even consider minimalism here. Everyone is incredibly busy
and rushed, fashion and shopping take center stage like almost nowhere else,
traffic and noise reach beautiful crescendos.

Can you be a minimalist in NYC?

You can be a minimalist anywhere. All you need to do is reject consumerism, and
learn to be content with little.

New York City seems to force people to have small apartments anyway, but many
seem to try to cram years of shopping into the apartment. Instead, allow the
constraint of space become a positive thing: have only the essentials, and
empty these small spaces of clutter. Learn to make the most of a small space.

Shopping here is an art. But there are other arts to be pursued: the public
library here is one of the most amazing tributes to learning I’ve ever seen,
for example. The art of reading can be practically free. The art of listening,
of being still, of being present with a friend, of walking aimlessly … these
are all free.

Fashion seems at the forefront of the minds of many, but that’s all in the
mind. I’ve walked around in second-hand jeans and simple T-shirts all day, and
no one seems to care. Reject the conformist values, and force people to judge
you on your talent, your voice, and your contributions, instead of your
clothes.

You can be a minimalist anywhere, because it is a mindset. We are influenced by
our environment, but we also create our environment, and we always have a
choice. You can slow down, be content with little, and value doing and being
over buying.
