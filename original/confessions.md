confessions of a minimalist

I have to confess that in recent years, I’ve often lost my minimalist way.

The reason is that I get caught up in an obsession, and then I let myself give
in to impulses.

For example:

* I got obsessed with chess last year, and bought a new chess set, a tournament set, and an embarrassing number of chess books. They’re all getting dusty right now.
* I got obsessed with ultralight backpacking this year, and ended up buying a large amount of ultralight hiking/camping equipment. I still hope to use all of it, but it’s mostly just sitting in my closet.
* I’ve bought a Fitbit, and a Fitbit scale, and barely use them anymore.
* I was training for an ultramarathon a few years ago, and bought a lot of equipment that I barely have used since then.
* I’ve bought too much coffee and tea equipment that I don’t use very often.
* I often buy sports and exercise equipment that I barely use.
* I have more clothes now than I did a few years ago. Not sure why.

None of this is very minimalist, and I don’t have any justification for any of
it. Much of it is still cluttering up my closet or garage and I can’t bear to
get rid of it all because a) it was expensive and b) I still have hopes of
using a lot of it. I confess, those are not good reasons to keep a bunch of
stuff I don’t use.

Why did I give in to these urges? Mostly because I was hopeful of having a life
that used them. I had fantasies, I think, of being a good chess player, a long-
distance hiker, an ultrarunner, etc. And I got attached to those fantasies and
then felt I needed to buy the things to support that lifestyle.

I don’t need those fantasies. I don’t need to become anything other than I am.

I don’t need the equipment to be active, enjoy the outdoors, play a simple game
of chess, play with my kids. I can get by with less.

I don’t need to hoard all of that stuff. I can keep a few things, sell the
rest.

I am still learning.
