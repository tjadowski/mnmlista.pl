letting go of desires

We all have desires – it’s part of the human condition.

We want to be loved, to have friends, to experience joy, to have security.

But a desire for _things_ is not as natural as we’re often led to believe.

Sure, we all have desires for things: nice cars, nice clothes, nice houses,
cool computers and iPhones, beautiful furniture and notebooks and shoes and
jewelry and bags and bikes and on and on.

But these desires are manufactured in us, by advertising and marketing. They
play on our natural instincts: for hoarding (security), for the pleasures of
food and drugs and sex (desire for joy), for fitting in with clothes and bikes
and gadgets (desire for friends), and so on.

Desires like these lead to all kinds of problems — in fact, all the problems of
modern society. They are rooted in the immense power of corporations in our
society, and their drive for massive profits. Problems result that include
obesity and related diseases, massive consumer debt, shallow consumerism,
overwork (to make money for all these things), lack of true human connection,
and more.

And while desires are perfectly natural and unavoidable, if we can learn to let
go of the manufactured desires, we’ll start to free ourselves from the chains
of consumerism.

Start to become aware of these desires – recognize their signs in you. Pause
before acting on them. Take deep breaths, go for a walk, get some perspective.

You don’t really need more things, and buying is not the answer. Make do
without and find happiness without more stuff.

Let the desire go, and feel the lightness, the freedom. Become liberated from
desires, one at a time (not forever, but for the moment). You’ll love it.
