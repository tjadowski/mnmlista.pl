the most minimal blog

While visiting relatives in Las Vegas, I decided to get away from the overly
conspicuous consumerism with an early morning run into the desert mountains.
Amidst the rocks I found a small cardboard sign with some neat handwriting on
it:

“February 11 marks our 3,068th day living out here. Thanks P+T (for 3 weeks
ago).”

Then there were numbers crossed out, marking the days after that, until it hit
today’s total of 3,150. It also had a note inserted among the numbers that said
“Happy Easter”.

It occurred to me that this hand-made sign is the most minimal blog there is.

Basically a statement of how long they’ve been living out in the desert, and
daily updates in the form of crossed-out numbers. With a shout out to friends,
of course.

What is blogging at its best? This sign distilled blogging to its essence:
regular updates that inspire others from someone doing something remarkable.

If you’re thinking of (or are already) blogging, don’t be intimidated. All you
need is to do something remarkable, and let people know about it. All you need
is a marker and a publicly-posted piece of cardboard, really.
