live more, need less

The more I focus on living, the less it seems I need.

What does it mean to focus on living? It’s a shift from caring about
possessions and status and goals and beautiful *things* … to caring about
actual life. Life includes: taking long walks, creating things, having
conversations with friends, snuggling with my wife, playing with my kids,
eating simple food, going outside and getting active.

That’s living. Not shopping, or watching TV, or eating loads of greasy and
sweet food not for sustenance but pleasure, or being on the Internet, or
ordering things online, or trying to get popular. Those things aren’t living –
they’re consumerist pastimes that tend to get us caught up in overconsumption
and mindlessness.

When I focus on living, all those other fake needs become less important. Why
do I need television when I can go outside and explore, or get active, or take
a walk with a friend? Why do I need to shop when I already have everything I
need – I can spend time with someone or create, and I need very little to do
that.

These things I do now — they require almost nothing. I can live, and need
little.

And needing little but getting lots of satisfaction … that’s immensely
rewarding. It’s an economy of resources that I’ve never experienced before.

These days, I need nothing but my loved ones, a text editor, a way to post what
I create, a good book, simple plant-based food, a few clothes for warmth, and
the outdoors.
