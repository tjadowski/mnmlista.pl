New: Version 3 of the mnmlist theme is here!

I developed a pretty minimalist WordPress theme for mnmlist.com, and I’d like
to share it with my fellow bloggers.

This theme is offered for free, uncopyrighted, as is.

A screenshot

The mnmlist theme is stripped bare, to the essentials, without any distractions
from the content. It features:

* A white, clean, uncluttered design.
* Distraction-free content.
* Minimalist footer.
* Nothing else.
* No header.
* No sidebar.
* No comments. If you want comments, you’ll have to add them in yourself.
* No widgets.
* No “open hooks”.
* No extra features.
* No copyright or DRM.
* No charge.

This is v3 of the theme. It’s still uncopyrighted and still free – and always
will be. In this version:

* I’ve stripped away more stuff
* fonts are improved
* still no sidebar, comments, header
* still has an archives page with search
* still has simplified design

Yes, I know that’s too minimalist for some people, so Version 1 is still
available below, with a header and sidebar.

Download_Version_3_of_the_mnmlist_theme.

Install:

1. Download the theme.
2. Unzip it.
3. Upload into your WordPress themes directory (in wp-content).
4. Go to your WordPress admin themes panel, activate mnmlist theme.
5. Customize index & footer to have whatever links, copyright you like. Feel
free to take out the mnmlist theme credit if you want.
6. Customize archives to reflect your domain in the search function, and your
blog’s categories.

More info in the README text file available in the theme’s folder.

Again, this is offered as is. If you want to customize it, feel free to do so!

Change the colors, fonts, link style … center the layout, move the sidebar
around, add comments, whatever you like. If there are bugs, fix them! I hope
find some value in the theme.

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why is there no header, sidebar, comments?

A: I intentionally made this as minimalist as possible. I removed all the
features I don’t want. If you want more features, I’d suggest another theme.
This theme allows readers to focus on the content, and nothing else.

Q: How do I change the links in the footer?

A: Instructions are in the “Read Me” file in the theme, but basically click on
Footer in the theme editor in WordPress. You’ll see the links to uncopyright
and this theme. Feel free to put your own copyright info or whatever you like
in the footer. No need to leave the credit in there, but I won’t mind if you
do.

Q: How do I center the layout instead of having it all the way to the left?

A: In the Stylesheet, at the top, add “margin: 0 auto;” inside the brackets of
the #container line. I think that should work but I could be wrong.

Q: How do I put pictures in posts?

A: Use the img tag. I tend to put them at the top of posts, before I start
writing the post. Here’s an example:
< img src=”http://mnmlist.com/fotos/20090909pocket.jpg” alt=”” / >
< small >Photo courtesy of < a href=”http://www.flickr.com/photos/
stuartpilbrow/2942333106/” >stuartpilbrow< /a >.< /small >
This is for the image and also for the photo credit below the image. Again,
take the spaces out before and after the brackets.

Q: How do I add comments into the theme?

A: That’s a little more complicated, but it’s doable. I can’t give you full
instructions here, but in a nutshell, what you’ll need to do:

1. Find a theme that uses comments that look the way you like them.
2. Copy the comments.php file into the mnmlist theme directory.
3. Copy the code that calls for the comments, in the Single Post file, and
paste it into the appropriate place in the Single Post file in the mnmlist
theme.
4. Copy the stylesheet css code for comments and paste it into the stylesheet
for the mnmlist theme.

You may need to experiment to get that to work the way you like.

Update: Danny Cooper modified Version 1 of this theme, adding comments. See_his
version_here.

I don’t plan to add comments or a sidebar or other features. In fact, if
anything I would remove more things in the future. If anyone wants to modify
this theme to add in other options, let me know on Twitter and I’ll link to it
from here.
