the beauty of small

Less can come in many forms. You can have fewer things, you can do fewer
things, you can use fewer things, you can focus on fewer things.

But less isn’t just fewer: it can also be smaller.

Small is often downplayed in this world of “bigger means better”. But small is
beautiful, and often better.

* Smaller banks aren’t “too big to fail”, requiring bailouts when they’re
mismanaged, and yet they make very important community loans.
* Smaller teams are more nimble, can adapt to changing environments faster,
don’t require as much management or communication overhead, can work cheaply
and from anywhere.
* Smaller cars use less gas, are more maneuverable, cause fewer deaths, use
fewer resources.
* Smaller homes require less heating, less cleaning, less maintenance, force
you to simplify, are cozier.
* Smaller programs use fewer computer resources, take up less computer power
and thus help the environment, work faster, get the job done with a minimum of
fuss.
* Smaller suitcases (such as a small backpack) are easier to carry around, fit
easier in overhead compartments, don’t require you to check luggage and worry
about luggage not getting to the right destination, are easier to pack and
unpack.
* Smaller websites (in terms of file sizes) are easier to load, faster, more
responsive.
* Smaller companies are also more responsive, less expensive, hungrier, more
focused.
* Smaller people are often faster, more nimble, humbler, take up fewer
resources, and are very very beautiful (my “wife”:http://twitter.com/ebabauta
is an example).
* Haikus pack a lot of punch into three tiny lines.
* Smaller posts don’t take as much time to write or read, which is good for a
lazy blogger. And a busy reader.

Small is beautiful. Aim for smaller when it makes sense, and enjoy the wonder
that ensues.
