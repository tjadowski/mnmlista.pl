walking ads

Minimalism is a pushing back against the trend to turn people into pure
consumers, into commodities, into a market-place mechanism.

We’ve lost sight of the simple truth that we need none of these products being
pushed on us by marketers and advertisers.

We’ve forgotten that we need_very_little, and so we buy so much.

And we are oblivious to the fact that corporations use us as advertisements and
marketing tools.

I find that disturbing. It’s disturbing in the first place that we’re being
used like this, but even more disturbing that we don’t realize it and willingly
participate in it.

When we wear things with the logos and slogans of the companies whose products
we use (Apple, Nike, Prada, Gucci), we are doing their advertising for them. We
are walking billboards. When we tweet about their new products, we aren’t just
sharing cool things with our friends, we are playing into their hands. When we
post reviews of new gadgets — or read them daily — we are not just sharing and
researching good information, we are a part of the marketing machine.

I’m as guilty as anyone, but I think it’s time for us all to reflect on this.

Let’s not be marketers for companies, no matter how cool we think they are.

Let’s not identify ourselves by what we buy and use, but what we create and how
we help others.

Let’s reject advertising as the dominant form of conversation these days, and
rediscover true human interaction.

I think we not only deserve this, we need it.
