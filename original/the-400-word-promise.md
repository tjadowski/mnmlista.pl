the 400-word promise

After some consideration, and feedback from Twitter friends, Iâ€™ve made a firm decision:
As of my last post, I will stick to a self-enforced, strictly-adhered-to limit of 400 words per post here on
*mnmlist*.

Unless I need more room.

I think this is in keeping with the philosophy of this site: keep things
minimal, stay brief, get to the point. When it makes sense.
