beat advertising

The reason advertising works on most of us is that we feel there is something
missing, that if we could only do or have X we could be happier, that we need
whatever happiness they’re offering.

If instead we could find completeness, find happiness, find contentedness …
advertising wouldn’t work. We’d say, “Thanks, but pass.”

And here’s the thing, of course (you knew this was coming): you already have
all that.

You just need to realize it, and internalize it.

You have everything you need for happiness, right now. The typical desires for
more money, a nicer house and car, nicer clothes and gadgets, a big-screen TV,
a super-successful career or business, etc. … none of that will get you
happiness.

Happiness is simple pleasures, is spending time doing what you love and
spending time with those you love. Happiness is realizing the world around us,
no matter where we are, is a miracle, is beautiful and filled with sources of
joy.

Do you have eyes? Then you have the tools to enjoy the sky, the water,
greenery, people — all miracles, all wonderful. Do you have ears? You have the
tools to enjoy music, and laughter, and conversation. Do you have taste buds?
You are blessed with a symphony of wonders, in berries and chocolate and
popcorn and pure water and mint and chocolate chip cookies and spicy Thai food.

These are the tools for happiness. Use them, and realize you are blessed beyond
belief.

Live life by appreciating every moment as a miracle, and you’ll want for
nothing. Appreciate the people around you, for the crazy complicated uniqueness
they are, and you’ll need no further entertainment.

You have it all. So when someone offers more, you can now say, “Thanks, but
pass.”

> Be content with what you have;
  rejoice in the way things are.
  When you realize there is nothing lacking,
  the whole world belongs to you.
  – Lao Tzu
