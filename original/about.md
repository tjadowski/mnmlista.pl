What is mnmlist.com?

It’s a site by Leo_Babauta of Zen_Habits.

It’s about minimalism, and why it’s important today.

It’s about stuff, and how it has come to overwhelm us.

It’s about distractions and commitments and a neverending task list.

It’s about the culture of more, of bigger, of consumption.

It’s about how less is the answer.
