10 essentials

I was reading a series in GQ called “10 Essentials”
ten-essentials where a designer or stylish celebrity names 10 things that are
essential to them. I love the idea, but the lists seem like such tributes to
luxury consumerism.

I’m the last guy that GQ would interview for this series (I have no sense of
style, to start with), but it got me to thinking: what are my “10 essentials”?

And so I made a list:

1. What I wear: jeans. I love the thick texture of jeans. I wear them every
day. Some people like synthetic fabrics because they’re lightweight and dry
fast, but jeans are just comfortable. I only buy my jeans at Goodwill.

2. What I also wear: T-shirt. I only have a few — black, blue, and grey — but I
wear them everyday until they get thin.

3. How I hydrate: water. I do drink coffee and tea, but neither compares to
plain water. I drink from the tap, throughout the day.

4. What I love to eat: fruit. Fresh from the farmer’s market, or berries picked
straight from the bush. Mmmm.

5. What entertains me: books. Any type. I get them used, from friends or the
library.

6.My essential writing tool: a text_editor. I’ll also take a pen and small
notebook, especially if I’m out and about and feel like writing.

7. What I do for fun: walk. I like to go outside and just take in the city, or
nature. I don’t even need shoes — barefoot walking is even more enjoyable. Even
better: walk with someone I like.

8. Where I go for inspiration: nature. A nice park, a garden, a forest, the
ocean, hills.

I ran out of things at this point — and the last couple aren’t exactly things.

I really tried for 10 items but I can’t think of more. If I have the 8 items
above, I’m very happy: jeans & t-shirt, water & fruit, a book and a notebook, a
walk in nature.

I could live on just those items — of course I’d need other food for
nourishment, but not much more. I don’t even need a computer — I could write in
a notebook and use a computer at a library to post to my blog.

You don’t need consumerism to be very happy — in fact, I’d argue that life is
better without it.
