minimalism: the lean life

Often people think that having more will lead to greater comfort, pleasure,
happiness and security. But in my experience, living a leaner life leads to
greater freedom, lightness, happiness and peace.

Take the example of traveling. There’s the case of the “prepared traveler” —
you can travel with everything you think you might need, from every possible
outfit combination to equipment, food, tons of electronics, books, notebooks,
travel pillows and blankets, multiple shoes, and more. This person has to lug
around a rolling suitcase plus a backpack, making travel more burdensome, more
stressful, more tiring. It takes awhile to travel anywhere, and then you’re
tired when you get there.

Then there’s the case of the light traveler. She carries almost nothing, just
the essentials, and doesn’t have to lug around anything heavy. As a result,
she’s faster, lighter, more energized, with greater freedom. She doesn’t always
have everything she might want, but she has what she needs, and learns to make
do with less. It’s actually not hard once you learn a few skills, and you don’t
feel stressed out.

This leanness values freedom, lightness, flexibility, energy and contentment
over maximum comfort, just-in-casedness, having it all.

A few other lean examples:

1. Weight: If you eat less … sure, you don’t get the gastronomical pleasures
      of someone who eats a huge amount of delicious food every day. But you
      learn to be happy with “enough,” so that you eat good, healthy food, and
      find pleasure outside of eating instead. And then you’re leaner and
      lighter, which allows you not only to be healthier, but you can do more
      activities with more energy, you can zip up a mountain or run a marathon
      or climb a rock wall with much more ease. Living with a leaner body is
      easier on the joints, less stressful, and gives you greater freedom.

2. Possessions: Lots of people shoot for a bigger house, accumulating more
      stuff over the years, feeling like more gives them greater comfort and
      security and ability to pursue hobbies and the like. I’m not immune to
      this myself. Instead, you could try going with less stuff. Imagine a bare
      room with a mattress, a few books, a notebook, a laptop and a handful of
      clothes. A cushion for meditating, a bowl for eating. A pot for cooking
      beans and veggies. I’m not saying you should have a house like this, but
      could you be happy with so little? I believe a wonderful life could be
      led with such leanness. And in doing so, you’d be lighter, less stressed,
      with less financial burden. You’d be less bloated and content with less.

3. Finances: Speaking of less financial burden … we often believe that
      having a bigger income will lead to greater happiness. And at the lower
      levels, when you go from poverty to the middle class, this is true. You
      don’t have to worry so much about putting food on the table. But when you
      go beyond this level, and have more and more income … you often have to
      work more in order to get it. And then you fill your life with
      possessions, bigger bills, more expensive cars, a more expensive house,
      more expensive luxuries. This doesn’t lead to greater happiness. Even if
      your income doesn’t get too high, you might load yourself up with
      expenses, and get into debt. This is stressful and a huge burden.
      Instead, living lean means you downsize your life so that you have fewer
      bills, you buy fewer things, you don’t spend a ton, and instead find
      contentment with little. And this not only gives you greater freedom and
      flexibility, but less stress. You can work less, travel more, focus more
      on experiences that cost little than on experiences and possessions that
      cost a lot.

4. Business: If you own a business, you know that it’s easy to “invest” in
      the business by spending a lot so that your business will grow. There’s
      nothing wrong with this, exactly, except that these expenses can quickly
      add up, and then you’re burdened with lots of expenses and not enough
      income. Your debt grows, your stress grows as you worry about how you’re
      going to pay for everything, you work harder than ever to get more
      income, but as you do your business grows in complexity and the expenses
      add up. Instead, there’s the option of creating a lean business. This is
      one that doesn’t take a lot of employees, that you bootstrap yourself
      instead of getting investors or debt, that you grow slowly but
      sustainably, and that you can limit so that you don’t have to work crazy
      hours. This leanness leads to greater flexibility, less burden, less
      stress, greater contentment.

You can see a theme here, as we go through these examples, that will extend to
any area of your life: leanness leads to greater freedom, flexibility,
lightness, and contentment. That’s not a bad deal for sacrificing luxuries and
excess.

Getting to lean is a matter of slimming down a little at a time, figuring out
what you can live with and still have optimal happiness. At some point, you’ll
experience the joy of letting go and getting light, which is a beautiful thing.
