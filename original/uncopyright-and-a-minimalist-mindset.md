uncopyright and the minimalist mindset

As some might know, I’m not a fan of copyright. In fact, I’ve uncopyrighted
this blog and my other blog, Zen_Habits.

And while uncopyright and minimalism might seem at first glance to be
unrelated, I believe they both stem from the same mindset.

Here’s how.

Copyright stems from a protective mindset, one that believes the creator owns
his work, and must protect that ownership in order to profit from said work.
The creator will share his work with others, but only at a price, and anyone
who takes without paying, or uses it as a basis for further creations, is
stealing.

That’s the copyright mindset.

The uncopyright mindset is that of someone who gives without any guarantee of
profit, who lets go of ownership and believes the world owns his creation. He
hopes to contribute to the world in a small way, and if others benefit from
this contribution, that’s a good thing. And if others use his contribution to
create something new and beautiful, that’s a wonderful thing.

The uncopyright creator lets go of ownership, because to hold on to ownership
hurts the world, and to try to protect that ownership leads to unnecessary
stress.

The minimalist also eschews ownership, at least to some degree, and believes
owning things doesn’t make him happy. Doing things makes him happy. Helping
others makes him happy. Creating makes him happy.

It is from this place that the minimalist embraces uncopyright, and in doing so
gives to the world and hopes that the world will be better for it, at least in
a tiny measure.
