why i won’t be buying an ipad

Because I don’t need one.

—

Honestly, I’m sure it’s the future of computing, the most beautiful computer
ever, the coolest thing since Pulp Fiction, the world’s best gaming platform,
the vehicle for some of the most amazing apps ever (already there are drool-worthy ones available) and I don’t doubt I’ll get one eventually. My wife will probably get one.

But I didn’t need an iPad last month or last year, and I will venture to guess
(I could be wrong) that I’ll be just as happy, fit and productive without the
iPad.

The iMac and Macbook Air I bought two years ago are working brilliantly and
fulfill my every computing need, and probably can for at least 2-3 more years.

I’ve resisted buying an iPhone for several years because I don’t need one
(despite their ultimate coolness), and the iPad is another way cool gadget I
don’t need.
