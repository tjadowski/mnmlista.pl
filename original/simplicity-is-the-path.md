simplicity is the path

> ‘There is no path to peace. Peace is the path.’ ~ *Mahatma Gandhi*, “Non-Violence in Peace and War”

Simplicity, many people think,

is an end in itself

But they’re getting it backwards

Simplicity is the path, the means

It’s not a far off destination,

somewhere in the future

It’s right here, right now

It’s taking things one at a time

It’s asking simple questions

It’s taking simple actions

It’s doing it slowly

It’s considering and being conscious,

with everything

When you find yourself becoming overwhelmed

on the path to simplicity

Taking a complicated, frenzied path

to get there

Stop, consider, and choose

the simpler path

And take it slowly

And easily

And lovely
