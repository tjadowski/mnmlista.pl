store everything in text files

When it comes to technology, I strongly believe that simpler is better.
We tend to take advantage of our increasingly powerful computing power by
always increasing the complexity of our tasks and data — no longer is
everything text-based (as the web used to be, way back when), but now
everything is graphical and increasingly uses video.

The result is a richer visual presentation, which is wonderful, but at the same
time pages are slower to load, applications become bloated and freeze up, and
information that could be presented simply and quickly is now presented via
video, making us wait minutes just to get one or two key pieces of information.
Complexity is bloated, slow, burdensome. Worse yet, our data is often tied up
in proprietary formats, in databases that can get corrupt, in formats that
don’t speak to other programs.

Simplicity is fast, lean, light. Data in simple formats — such as text — is
mobile, can be ported to any program, is not locked into a proprietary program
or database.

I’m moving more and more toward text files, after having been a fan of more
complex formats and programs for a few years.

I love programs like Evernote, Yojimbo, even the simple Notational_Velocity —
but the truth is, text files are just as good. And they’re faster and simpler.
I can load my favorite text editor (TextEdit, super simple) and be typing in
two seconds. It takes a few extra seconds to load a bigger program such as
Evernote or Yojimbo, and each of these takes up way more system memory and
slows things down. Even the lightweight Notational Velocity, a great program,
stores info in a database that can be corrupted, in a format that can’t be
ported elsewhere.

While I love graphical programs, they are just overkill for my needs. Your
needs may be more complex, more demanding, but mine aren’t.

I write posts, articles, books in TextEdit (or WriteRoom, when I feel too many
distractions), then paste them wherever they’re needed.

I keep notes, todo lists (when I need them), other info I need saved, in a text
file or three. They can be popped open in half a second, and with a quick
“Find” command, I can find any info.

Again, my needs are purposely simple. And text files are purposely minimalist,
lightweight, fast, lean, and thusly beautiful.

Updates:

* PStevenP asked if I store my text files in Google Docs. I haven’t done that
yet – I usually only do that when I share something. Lately I’ve just been
using DropBox to sync files. I do love me some Google Docs though. I’m still
figuring out the best method.
* victorluft and scrod both point out that you can set Notational Velocity to
store your info via text files, which I didn’t know. That makes it a viable way
of managing your text files, imo. Read_more.
* abhidg suggested Todo.txt as a lightweight command-line app to manage a text
to-do list. Not bad. I probably won’t use it – TextEdit is fine with me – but
it’s a good alternative for those who prefer command-line.
* AndreaAresca asks for a Windows alternative to TextEdit. When I was on a PC I
used to use either Notepad or Notepad++.
