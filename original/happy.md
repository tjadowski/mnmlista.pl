as happy as possible

I believe I’m as happy as it is possible to be.

I’m not crying out in ecstatic pleasure, or streaming tears of joy, but I am
very happy. It’s not a peak of happiness, but a plateau of happiness that can
go on for as long as I live.

This is a happiness I wish on everyone alive. The question then is, what are
the factors that contribute to my happiness?

Here’s what I don’t have:

1. A huge house
2. Massive wealth
3. Fancy clothes
4. A nice car
5. A powerful job
6. Cable TV

And I don’t believe having any of those would contribute to greater happiness
than I already have.

Here’s what I do have that contribute to my happiness:

1. Time
2. Loving relationships
3. Meaningful work
4. Health
5. Books
6. Enough

The first six are seen as the goals of society by many people. The second six
make me very happy, and I believe I have them because I decided to forgo the
first six. I recommend this path.
