learn to love less

> “The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in
  developing the capacity to enjoy less.” *- Socrates*

In that one little line, Socrates summed up one of the major problems with our
modern society, and offered a simple solution.

Pretty brilliant, I’d say.

In fact, he negated the need for me to write more, but stubborn as I am, I will
proceed. I’d like to talk about this capacity to enjoy less.

Is it difficult to enjoy less? No, not really, but it takes a change in
mindset, which as with many such changes takes time and adaptation.

If you enjoy chocolate ice cream, as I do, when confronted with a tub of it
would you also enjoy eating as much of the tub as possible? I know that’s what
many of us do when faced with delicious food.

But what if you learned to enjoy just a few bites of the ice cream? And with
each bite, savor the flavor, the coldness, the creaminess, the chocolatiness.
(Yes, that’s a word, spell-checker – I made it up.)

If you love clothes, instead of buying more and more each weekend, can you
learn to cull your wardrobe into a few quality, beautiful pieces that you can
wear often, and enjoy more?

The same applies with anything we love … including online reading and
communicating (email, Twitter, Facebook, forums). We often seem obsessed with
more of it. But instead, consider reading just the quality stuff, and if a blog
or Twitter feed doesn’t deliver quality consistently, consider dropping it.

Learn to love less television, movies, chatter, spending, shopping, eating out,
junk food, technology, consumption, productivity. You get the idea.

When you focus on enjoying less, you focus on full enjoyment. You learn to be
content with little, and when you do that, a life of happiness is at your
disposal. The only limit to your happiness, then, is how much you can learn to
enjoy less.
