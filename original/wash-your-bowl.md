wash your bowl

There’s a famous Zen story that goes:

> A monk told Joshu, “I have just entered the monastery. Please teach me.”
  Joshu asked, “Have you eaten your rice porridge?
  The monk replied, “I have eaten.”
  Joshu said, “Then you had better wash your bowl.”
  At that moment the monk was enlightened.

I’m not going to try to explain that story, as I am far from enlightened enough
to understand it. Instead, I’d like to focus the wonderful simplicity of that
advice:

> Have you eaten your rice porridge? Then you had better wash your bowl.

This is something I think of every time I eat, and in fact whenever I’m done
doing something. “Done eating? Then wash your bowl.”

There is something profound and yet minimalist about this advice. It’s: don’t
get your head caught up in all this thinking about the meaning of life …
instead, just do. Just wash your bowl. And in the washing, you’ll find all you
need.

I’ve found this to be true. I literally wash my bowl after eating, slowly and
with mindfulness. It’s satisfying, and takes no money and little resources.

When I take a shower, I hand wash my dirty clothes (if they’re dirty), wring
them out, hang them to dry. When I change, I carefully put away the clothes
I’ve changed out of. When I prepare food, I wipe the counter and put away the
ingredients. At least I try to – I don’t claim to be perfect.

Remembering to do these things when we’re done with the activity isn’t just
about neatness. It’s about mindfulness, about completing what we started, about
being present in all we do instead of rushing to the next activity.

Wash your bowl, with care and joy.
