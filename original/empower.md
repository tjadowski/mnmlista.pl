empower people to create

We live in a world where we are passive consumers: we see an ad for an iPhone,
new car, new clothes; we go to the store or website and buy the item; we use
it, and then dispose of it when we’re done.

What if we could break free from that?

What if we could become creators, participants, sharers, empowerers?

An awesome_article about three guys who not only build bamboo bicycles, but
show people how to make them themselves, really highlights how this can be
done.

These guys are transforming people from passive consumers to creators,
builders, knowledgeable users. That’s amazing.

How can you empower people? How can you turn people from consumers into makers?

How can you help people from being passive users to knowledgeable ones?

Change the world — it’s waiting for you.
