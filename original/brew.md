I am not a brewer

I’ve been learning a bit about beers lately (and enjoying the learning process)
and on the top beer_ratings sites a beer from the Westvleteren_Brewery tops the
rankings.

It’s a Belgium beer brewed by monks who absolutely fascinate me. They brew the
best beer in the world and yet seem to care nothing about business. As their
beer has gained fame they refuse to raise production to meet demand. They
refuse to market their beers and have no label on their bottles. They do no
advertising and don’t allow interviews or tours of their brewery — you can
visit a visitors’ center across the street but they don’t want to be bothered.
You can only buy two cases at a time and you have to drive to their brewery to
get it — and only after reserving via phone.

They are crazy dudes but I love them. They are not interested in making money
or fame or accomplishments. They just want to be monks.

Father Abbott said on the occasion of the consecration of their new brewery
“But we do not live ‘for’ our brewery. This must be strange for business people
and difficult to understand that we do not exploit our commercial assets as
much as we can.”

He went on to say “We are no brewers. We are monks. We brew beer to be able to
afford being monks.”

I’m with him.

I am not a blogger. I am no author. I am a simple man who enjoys a simple life
with his family. I write to be able to afford living that simple life.
