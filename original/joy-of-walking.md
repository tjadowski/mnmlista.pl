the joy of walking

Today I set out from my house and walked. And walked.

I didn’t have a specific destination in mind, but wanted to walk a bit before
finding a quiet place to write. So I walked, out of the town where I live and
along the tropical, white-sand coastline, to the next town over.

As others drove cocooned in their cars, I walked, and emitted nothing but my
breath.

As others spent their lunch hour pounding down fat-laden burgers and greasy
fries or some other cheesy fried piled-high dish, I walked, and burned
calories.

As others rushed and stressed, I walked, and took my time.

As others sat at their computers, I walked, and got my blood flowing.

As others held power business meetings and made deals, I walked, and had time
to think.

As others were productive and got tasks done, I walked and got nothing done,
and cleared my head.

As others had the comfort of shelter and air-conditioning, I walked and worked
up a light sweat and was buffeted by the wind.

As a white gull floated serenely above a calm bay, I walked, and watched, and
loved it.

I walked for an hour, then wrote and read, and then walked for another hour to
get back home, tired but happy.

I can’t walk this much every day, but I walk as much as I can, because you need
nothing to walk, you spend nothing, you consume nothing, you emit nothing.

And yet you have everything.
