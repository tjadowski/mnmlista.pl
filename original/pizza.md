spartan pizza napoletana

A good Neapolitan pizza is a thing of spartan beauty: minimal ingredients that
are fresh, stand out, and come together in a way that transcends food and art
and beauty — it’s an act of pure love.

My favorite is the Margherita. A simple crust is hand-made, hand-stretched,
spread thinly with fresh tomato sauce, with chunks of mozzarella (or vegan
cheese) and sprigs of basil strewn about its surface, finished off with a
drizzle of perfect olive oil. It goes into an incredibly hot wood oven, where
the crust blisters in 60 seconds and, in that briefest moment of purity by
fire, a miracle occurs.

The miracle is that these simple ingredients — flour, water, tomatoes, cheese,
basil, oil, salt — become the most heavenly substance in the universe: love.

Each ingredient, because it’s not overwhelmed by a smorgasbord of toppings
(sausages and four kinds of cheese and caramelized onions and Thai chicken and
broccoli or what have you), can be tasted distinctly and appreciated for its
simple beauty. Having fewer ingredients allows each to assert itself.

But they also come together in an act of perfect unity, and this shows what
minimalism is about. A few things of beauty, when stripped of the extraneous,
are allowed to breathe, to shine, to then create a whole that is better than a
whole of too many less important things.

This is true of pizza, but also of work and life. Cut back to a few important
tasks and your work will be transformed. Do only a few things in life and those
things will breathe and take on an importance they never had before. They will
create a life that is not only better but is a truer expression of yourself not
possible without minimalism.

Minimalism allows your life to be an act of love.
